# Special ssh config
# - It removes the Platform.sh' SSH key/certificate from the agent before everything else
# - It adds the Platform.sh' SSH key/certificate to the agent after
# - It forward agent keys through ssh for platform.sh domains
#
# This is to make sure that any new certificate gets added (if refreshed) and to
# avoid leaving lingering certificates in the ddev ssh-agent.
